# Academic Scripts
Scripts for Reaper DAW


NEW! Academic Articulations - make simple articulations in seconds. Be sure they are work as a trigger - they are created one pixel before notes you select.


Academic Dynamic - select midi notes and see how velocity will change by your magic fingers. Use academic dynamics such as ppp, mf or fff etc. Make a crescendo and diminuendo. Replace X velocity value to Y. Get a random in range. Go away MIDI Editor to Arrange View window to set velocity to each selected item. SWS is required.


NEW! Academic Voice - Select any voice in selected tracks - as original classic way or upside down (top down or bottom up).


Academic Piano - play on your pc keyboard anytime. Anywhere. With one button.


Auto Aim Midi* - glue edit cursor to start or end of selected note or notes. It has the main script and the switch scriipt. Best script for working with foleys.


NEW! Auto Aim Item* - an exact copy of the Auto Aim Midi script, but applied to items and also consists of two scripts - the main one and the switch. Enjoy.


Academic Chords - get up to 117 chords! Select notes, chords or chords and notes and go. Get random chord for notes and chords you select. Get random chords individually to each note and chord you select. Rein this horse by making a filters - and all random chords will contain what you want. Make a chords by tonality you select.


Comments (beta) - see all your empty_notes with text in one window. Navigate between them. Mute it with checkboxes. See where are you by highlights on every empty_note. SWS is required.


Conductor Mode (beta) - slows down the selected part of the project by 30% and then by 50%, and then returns the original tempo. The script will be useful for those who want to hear their mush at a slower tempo without making unnecessary movements. Why beta? Because the created markers are not deleted yet. 


Academic Pitch - use academic symbols such as "b" or "#" to change a pitch. You can get more with combinate them - bb, ##, /b, /# etc. 


Academic Ornaments - set trills and forshlags here. And now YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN ORNAMENTS (instructions is inside the code).


In all (almost) scripts added instruction - call with the "i" letter. The window header text "Error" is replaced with ":(". Each script automatically switches the visibility of the CC lane to the event it is working with. Each script keep midi editor focused after use.


P.S. The Academic Ornaments and Academic Pitch scripts is out-of-date and I didn't pay any attention to them as they seemed useless to me.
